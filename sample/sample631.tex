%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.31 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls and other external packages such as
%% latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf.  Note that as of 
%% Oct 2020, APS now uses revtex4.2e for its journals but remember that 
%% AASTeX v6+ still uses v4.1. All of these external packages should 
%% already be present in the modern TeX distributions but not always.
%% For example, revtex4.1 seems to be missing in the linux version of
%% TexLive 2020. One should be able to get all packages from www.ctan.org.
%% In particular, revtex v4.1 can be found at 
%% https://www.ctan.org/pkg/revtex4-1.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%% using aastex version 6.3
\documentclass[linenumbers]{aastex631}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be invoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[arguments]{aastex631}
%% 
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%  RNAAS       : Supresses an abstract. Originally for RNAAS manuscripts 
%%                but now that abstracts are required this is obsolete for
%%                AAS Journals. Authors might need it for other reasons. DO NOT
%%                use \begin{abstract} and \end{abstract} with this style.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can invoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%   astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%   tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                  the twocolumn substyle.
%%   times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%   linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%   trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%   longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                  the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                  affiliation information after each name. Creates a much 
%%                  longer author list but may be desirable for short 
%%                  author papers.
%% twocolappendix : make 2 column appendix.
%%   anonymous    : Do not show the authors, affiliations and acknowledgments 
%%                  for dual anonymous review.
%%
%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex631}
%%
%% AASTeX v6.* now includes \hyperref support. While we have built in specific
%% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them with the
%% \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%% \hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003
%%
%% Note that in v6.3 "bookmarks" has been changed to "true" in hyperref
%% to improve the accessibility of the compiled pdf file.
%%
%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.
%%
\newcommand{\vdag}{(v)^\dagger}
\newcommand\aastex{AAS\TeX}
\newcommand\latex{La\TeX}

%% Reintroduced the \received and \accepted commands from AASTeX v5.2
%\received{March 1, 2021}
%\revised{April 1, 2021}
%\accepted{\today}

%% Command to document which AAS Journal the manuscript was submitted to.
%% Adds "Submitted to " the argument.
%\submitjournal{PSJ}

%% For manuscript that include authors in collaborations, AASTeX v6.31
%% builds on the \collaboration command to allow greater freedom to 
%% keep the traditional author+affiliation information but only show
%% subsets. The \collaboration command now must appear AFTER the group
%% of authors in the collaboration and it takes TWO arguments. The last
%% is still the collaboration identifier. The text given in this
%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors 
%% on the front page.
%%
%% For manuscript without any need to use \collaboration the 
%% \AuthorCollaborationLimit command from v6.2 can still be used to 
%% show a subset of authors.
%
%\AuthorCollaborationLimit=2
%
%% will only show Schwarz & Muench on the front page of the manuscript
%% (assuming the \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands are
%% commented out).
%%
%% Note that all of the author will be shown in the published article.
%% This feature is meant to be used prior to acceptance to make the
%% front end of a long author article more manageable. Please do not use
%% this functionality for manuscripts with less than 20 authors. Conversely,
%% please do use this when the number of authors exceeds 40.
%%
%% Use \allauthors at the manuscript end to show the full author list.
%% This command should only be used with \AuthorCollaborationLimit is used.

%% The following command can be used to set the latex table counters.  It
%% is needed in this document because it uses a mix of latex tabular and
%% AASTeX deluxetables.  In general it should not be needed.
%\setcounter{table}{1}

%% The following section outlines numerous optional output that
%% can be displayed in the front matter or as running meta-data.

\title{Template \aastex Article with Examples: 
v6.31\footnote{Released on March, 1st, 2021}}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.31 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affiliations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% auto-indexing of affiliations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% argument which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid. If the "orcid-ID.png" image file is 
%% present or in the LaTeX pathway, the OrcID icon will appear next to
%% the authors name.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.31 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.31 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

%% Note that the \and command from previous versions of AASTeX is now

%% automatically takes care of all commas and "and"s between authors names.

%% AASTeX 6.31 has the new \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands to
%% provide the collaboration status of a group of authors. These commands 
%% can be used either before or after the list of corresponding authors. The
%% argument for \collaboration is the collaboration identifier. Authors are
%% encouraged to surround collaboration identifiers with ()s. The

\begin{abstract}

This example manuscript is intended to serve as a tutorial and template for
authors to use when writing their own AAS Journal articles. The manuscript
includes a history of \aastex\ and documents the new features in the
previous versions as well as the bug fixes in version 6.31. This
manuscript includes many figure and table examples to illustrate these new
features.  Information on features not explicitly mentioned in the article
can be viewed in the manuscript comments or more extensive online
documentation. Authors are welcome replace the text, tables, figures, and
bibliography with their own and submit the resulting manuscript to the AAS
Journals peer review system.  The first lesson in the tutorial is to remind
authors that the AAS Journals, the Astrophysical Journal (ApJ), the
Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL), the Astronomical Journal (AJ), and
the Planetary Science Journal (PSJ) all have a 250 word limit for the 
abstract\footnote{Abstracts for Research Notes of the American Astronomical 
Society (RNAAS) are limited to 150 words}.  If you exceed this length the
Editorial office will ask you to shorten it. This abstract has 182 words.

\end{abstract}

%% Keywords should appear after the \end{abstract} command. 
%% The AAS Journals now uses Unified Astronomy Thesaurus concepts:
%% https://astrothesaurus.org
%% You will be asked to selected these concepts during the submission process
%% but this old "keyword" functionality is maintained in case authors want
%% to include these concepts in their preprints.
\keywords{Classical Novae (251) --- Ultraviolet astronomy(1736) --- History of astronomy(1868) --- Interdisciplinary astronomy(804)}

%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% Sections are demarcated by \section and \subsection, respectively.
%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.
%%
%% We recommend that authors also use the natbib \citep
%% and \citet commands to identify citations.  The citations are
%% tied to the reference list via symbolic KEYs. The KEY corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \bibitem in the reference list below. 

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\latex\ \footnote{\url{http://www.latex-project.org/}} is a document markup
language that is particularly well suited for the publication of
mathematical and scientific articles \citep{lamport94}. \latex\ was written
in 1985 by Leslie Lamport who based it on the \TeX\ typesetting language
which itself was created by Donald E. Knuth in 1978.  In 1988 a suite of
\latex\ macros were developed to investigate electronic submission and
publication of AAS Journal articles \citep{1989BAAS...21..780H}.  Shortly
afterwards, Chris Biemesdefer merged these macros and more into a \latex\
2.08 style file called \aastex.  These early \aastex\ versions introduced
many common commands and practices that authors take for granted today.
Substantial revisions
were made by Lee Brotzman and Pierre Landau when the package was updated to
v4.0.  AASTeX v5.0, written in 1995 by Arthur Ogawa, upgraded to \latex\ 2e
which uses the document class in lieu of a style file.  Other improvements
to version 5 included hypertext support, landscape deluxetables and
improved figure support to facilitate electronic submission.  
\aastex\ v5.2 was released in 2005 and introduced additional graphics
support plus new mark up to identifier astronomical objects, datasets and
facilities.

In 1996 Maxim Markevitch modified the AAS preprint style file, aaspp4.sty,
to closely emulate the very tight, two column style of a typeset
Astrophysical Journal article.  The result was emulateapj.sty.  A year
later Alexey Vikhlinin took over development and maintenance.  In 2001 he
converted emulateapj into a class file in \latex\ 2e and in 2003 Vikhlinin
completely rewrote emulateapj based on the APS Journal's RevTEX class.

During this time emulateapj gained growing acceptance in the astronomical
community as it filled an author need to obtain an approximate number of
manuscript pages prior to submission for cost and length estimates. The
tighter typeset also had the added advantage of saving paper when printing
out hard copies.

Even though author publication charges are no longer based on print pages
\footnote{see Section \ref{sec:pubcharge} in the Appendix for more details
about how current article costs are calculated.} the emulateapj class file
has proven to be extremely popular with AAS Journal authors.  An 
analysis of submitted \latex\ manuscripts in 2015 revealed that $\sim$65\%
either called emulateapj or have a commented emulateapj classfile call
indicating it was used at some stage of the manuscript construction.
Clearly authors want to have access to a tightly typeset version of the
article when corresponding with co-authors and for preprint submissions.

When planning the next \aastex\ release the popularity of emulateapj played
an important roll in the decision to drop the old base code and adopt and
modify emulateapj for \aastex\ v6.+ instead.  The change brings \aastex\
inline with what the majority of authors are already using while still
delivering new and improved features.  \aastex\ v6.0 through v6.31 were
written by Amy Hendrickson. The release dates were January 2016 (v6.0),
October 2016 (v6.1), January 2018 (v6.2), June 2019 (v6.3), and March 2010
(v6.31) respectively.

The new features in the recent releases includes:

\begin{itemize}
 \item{v6.0}
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item line numbering and watermarking,
      \item improved citations for third party data repositories and software,
      \item easier construction of matrix figures consisting of multiple 
encapsulated postscript (EPS) or portable document format (PDF) files,
      \item figure set mark up for large collections of similar figures,
      \item color mark up to easily enable/disable revised text highlighting,
      \item improved url support, and
      \item numerous table options such as the ability to hide columns, column decimal alignment, automatic column math mode and numbering, plus splitting of wide tables (see Section \ref{subsec:tables} for details).
    \end{enumerate}
  \item{v6.1}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item ORCID support for preprints,
      \item improved author, affiliation and collaboration mark up,
      \item reintroduced the old AASTeX v5.2 {\tt\string\received}, {\tt\string\revised}, {\tt\string\accepted}, and {\tt\string\published} commands plus added the new {\tt\string\submitjournal} command to document which AAS Journal the manuscript was submitted to, plus
      \item new typeset style options including {\tt\string modern}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item{v6.2}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A new RNAAS style option for Research Note manuscripts,
      \item Titles no longer put in all caps,
      \item No page skip between the title page and article body,
      \item re-introduce RevTeX's widetext environment for long lines in two column style formats, and
      \item upgrade to the {\tt\string\doi} command.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item{v6.3}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item New {\tt\string interactive} environment to highlight interactive figures (see Section \ref{animation}),
      \item Improved collaboration commands, 
      \item New {\tt\string anonymous} style to keep the authors, affiliations and acknowledgments from showing in the compiled pdf for dual anonymous review, and
      \item Adoptions of IAU approved syntax for nominal units, see Section \ref{nominal}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item{v6.31}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Fixes a bug in the {\tt\string anonymous} style for dual anonymous review.
      \item Improves line numbering with the {\tt\string linenumbers} style around equations due to the amsmath and lineno package compatibility issues.
      \item Depreciate the {\tt\string \\acknowledgment} command in favor of the {\tt\string acknowledgment} environment.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

The rest of this article provides information and examples on how to create
your own AAS Journal manuscript with v6.31.  Special emphasis is placed on
how to use the full potential of \aastex\ v6+.  The next section describes
the different manuscript styles available and how they differ from past
releases.  Section \ref{sec:floats} describes table and figure placement. 
Specific examples of tables, Section
\ref{subsec:tables}, and figures, Section \ref{subsec:figures}, are also
provided. A special emphasis is placed on interactive figures.
Section \ref{sec:displaymath} discusses how to display math and
incorporate equations in a manuscript while Section \ref{sec:highlight}
discuss how to use different ways to highlight revisions.  The last section,
\ref{sec:cite}, shows how recognize software and external data as first
class references in the manuscript bibliography.  An appendix is included
for additional information readers might find useful.
More documentation is embedded in the comments of this \latex\ file and in the online documentation at
\url{http://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex.html}.

\section{Manuscript styles} \label{sec:style}

The default style in \aastex\ v6.31 is a tight single column style, e.g. 10
point font, single spaced.  The single column style is very useful for
article with wide equations. It is also the easiest to style to work with
since figures and tables, see Section \ref{sec:floats}, will span the
entire page, reducing the need for address float sizing.

To invoke a two column style similar to the what is produced in
the published PDF copy use \\

\noindent {\tt\string\documentclass[twocolumn]\{aastex631\}}. \\

\noindent Note that in the two column style figures and tables will only
span one column unless specifically ordered across both with the ``*'' flag,
e.g. \\

\noindent{\tt\string\begin\{figure*\}} ... {\tt\string\end\{figure*\}}, \\
\noindent{\tt\string\begin\{table*\}} ... {\tt\string\end\{table*\}}, and \\
\noindent{\tt\string\begin\{deluxetable*\}} ... {\tt\string\end\{deluxetable*\}}. \\

\noindent This option is ignored in the onecolumn style.

Some other style options are outlined in the commented sections of this 
article.  Any combination of style options can be used.

Two style options that are needed to fully use the new revision tracking
feature, see Section \ref{sec:highlight}, are {\tt\string linenumbers} which 
uses the lineno style file to number each article line in the left margin and 
{\tt\string trackchanges} which controls the revision and commenting highlight
output.

There is also a new {\tt\string modern} option that uses a Daniel
Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design to produce stylish, single column
output that has wider left and right margins. It is designed to have fewer
words per line to improve reader retention. It also looks better on devices
with smaller displays such as smart phones.

The {\tt\string anonymous} option will prevent the author and affiliations
from being shown in the compiled pdf copy. This option allows the author 
to keep this critical information in the latex file but prevent the reviewer
from seeing it during peer review if dual anonymous review (DAR) is requested. 
Likewise, acknowledgments can also be hidden if placed in the new 
{\tt\string\begin\{acknowledgments\}} ... {\tt\string\end\{acknowledgments\}}
environment. The use of this option is highly recommended for PSJ submissions. 
Advice for anonymizing your manuscript for DAR is provided at 
\url{https://journals.aas.org/manuscript-preparation/#dar}.

\section{Floats} \label{sec:floats}

Floats are non-text items that generally can not be split over a page.
They also have captions and can be numbered for reference.  Primarily these
are figures and tables but authors can define their own. \latex\ tries to
place a float where indicated in the manuscript but will move it later if
there is not enough room at that location, hence the term ``float''.

Authors are encouraged to embed their tables and figures within the text as
they are mentioned.  Please do not place the figures and text at the end of
the article as was the old practice.  Editors and the vast majority of
referees find it much easier to read a manuscript with embedded figures and
tables.

Depending on the number of floats and the particular amount of text and
equations present in a manuscript the ultimate location of any specific
float can be hard to predict prior to compilation. It is recommended that
authors textbf{not} spend significant time trying to get float placement
perfect for peer review.  The AAS Journal's publisher has sophisticated
typesetting software that will produce the optimal layout during
production.

Note that authors of Research Notes are only allowed one float, either one
table or one figure.

For authors that do want to take the time to optimize the locations of
their floats there are some techniques that can be used.  The simplest
solution is to placing a float earlier in the text to get the position
right but this option will break down if the manuscript is altered.
A better method is to force \latex\ to place a
float in a general area with the use of the optional {\tt\string [placement
specifier]} parameter for figures and tables. This parameter goes after
{\tt\string \begin\{figure\}}, {\tt\string \begin\{table\}}, and
{\tt\string \begin\{deluxetable\}}.  The main arguments the specifier takes
are ``h'', ``t'', ``b'', and ``!''.  These tell \latex\ to place the float
\underline{h}ere (or as close as possible to this location as possible), at
the \underline{t}op of the page, and at the \underline{b}ottom of the page.
The last argument, ``!'', tells \latex\ to override its internal method of
calculating the float position.  A sequence of rules can be created by
using multiple arguments.  For example, {\tt\string \begin\{figure\}[htb!]}
tells \latex\ to try the current location first, then the top of the page
and finally the bottom of the page without regard to what it thinks the
proper position should be.  Many of the tables and figures in this article
use a placement specifier to set their positions.

Note that the \latex\ {\tt\string tabular} environment is not a float.  Only
when a {\tt\string tabular} is surrounded by {\tt\string\begin\{table\}} ...
{\tt\string\end\{table\}} is it a true float and the rules and suggestions
above apply.

In AASTeX v6.31 all deluxetables are float tables and thus if they are
longer than a page will spill off the bottom. Long deluxetables should
begin with the {\tt\string\startlongtable} command. This initiates a
longtable environment.  Authors might have to use {\tt\string\clearpage} to
isolate a long table or optimally place it within the surrounding text.

\subsection{Tables} \label{subsec:tables}

Tables can be constructed with \latex's standard table environment or the
\aastex's deluxetable environment. The deluxetable construct handles long
tables better but has a larger overhead due to the greater amount of
defined mark up used set up and manipulate the table structure.  The choice
of which to use is up to the author.  Examples of both environments are
used in this manuscript. 

Tables longer than 200 data lines and complex tables should only have a
short example table with the full data set available in the machine
readable format.  The machine readable table will be available in the HTML
version of the article with just a short example in the PDF. Authors are
required to indicate in the table comments that the data in machine 
readable format in the full article.
Authors are encouraged to create their own machine
readable tables using the online tool at
\url{http://authortools.aas.org/MRT/upload.html}.

\aastex\ v6 introduced five new table features that were designed to make
table construction easier and the resulting display better for AAS Journal
authors.  The items are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Declaring math mode in specific columns,
\item Column decimal alignment, 
\item Automatic column header numbering,
\item Hiding columns, and
\item Splitting wide tables into two or three parts.
\end{enumerate}

Full details on how to create each type are given in the following 
sections. Additional details are available in the AASTeX
guidelines at \url{http://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex.html}

\subsubsection{Column math mode}

Both the \latex\ tabular and \aastex\ deluxetable require an argument to
define the alignment and number of columns.  The most common values are
``c'', ``l'' and ``r'' for \underline{c}enter, \underline{l}eft, and
\underline{r}ight justification.  If these values are capitalized, e.g.
``C'', ``L'', or ``R'', then that specific column will automatically be in math
mode meaning that \$s are not required.  Note that having embedded dollar
signs in the table does not affect the output. 

\subsubsection{Decimal alignment}

Aligning a column by the decimal point can be difficult with only center,
left, and right justification options.  It is possible to use phantom calls
in the data, e.g. {\tt\string\phn}, to align columns by hand but this can
be tedious in long or complex tables.  To address this \aastex\ introduces
the {\tt\string\decimals} command and a new column justification option,
``D'', to align data in that column on the decimal.  In deluxetable the
{\tt\string\decimals} command is invoked before the {\tt\string\startdata}
call but can be anywhere in \latex's tabular environment.  

Two other important thing to note when using decimal alignment is that each
decimal column \textit{must end with a space before the ampersand}, e.g.
``\&\&'' is not allowed.  Empty decimal columns are indicated with a decimal,
e.g. ``.''.  Do not use deluxetable's {\tt\string\nodata} command.

The ``D'' alignment token works by splitting the column into two parts on the
decimal.  While this is invisible to the user one must be aware of how it
works so that the headers are accounted for correctly.  All decimal column
headers need to span two columns to get the alignment correct. This can be
done with a multicolumn call, e.g {\tt\string\multicolumn2c\{\}} or
{\tt\string\multicolumn\{2\}\{c\}\{\}}, or use the new
{\tt\string\twocolhead\{\}} command in deluxetable.  Since \latex\ is
splitting these columns into two it is important to get the table width
right so that they appear joined on the page.  You may have to run the
\latex\ compiler twice to get it right.  

\subsubsection{Automatic column header numbering} \label{subsubsec:autonumber}

The command {\tt\string\colnumbers} can be included to automatically number
each column as the last row in the header. Per the AAS Journal table format
standards, each column index numbers will be surrounded by parentheses. In
a \latex\ tabular environment the {\tt\string\colnumbers} should be invoked
at the location where the author wants the numbers to appear, e.g. after
the last line of specified table header rows. In deluxetable this command
has to come before {\tt\string\startdata}.  {\tt\string\colnumbers} will
not increment for columns hidden by the ``h'' command, see Section
\ref{subsubsec:hide}. 

Note that when using decimal alignment in a table the command 
{\tt\string\decimalcolnumbers} must be used instead of 
{\tt\string\colnumbers} and {\tt\string\decimals}. 

\subsubsection{Hiding columns} \label{subsubsec:hide}

Entire columns can be \underline{h}idden from display simply by changing
the specified column identifier to ``h''.  In the \latex\ tabular environment
this column identifier conceals the entire column including the header
columns.   In \aastex's deluxetables the header row is specifically
declared with the {\tt\string\tablehead} call and each header column is
marked with {\tt\string\colhead} call.  In order to make a specific header
disappear with the ``h'' column identifier in deluxetable use 
{\tt\string\nocolhead} instead to suppress that particular column header.

Authors can use this option in many different ways.  Since column data can
be easily suppressed authors can include extra information and hid it
based on the comments of co-authors or referees.  For wide tables that will
have a machine readable version, authors could put all the information in
the \latex\ table but use this option to hid as many columns as needed until
it fits on a page. This concealed column table would serve as the
example table for the full machine readable version.  Regardless of how
columns are obscured, authors are responsible for removing any unneeded
column data or alerting the editorial office about how to treat these
columns during production for the final typeset article.

Table \ref{tab:messier} provides some basic information about the first ten
Messier Objects and illustrates how many of these new features can be used
together.  It has automatic column numbering, decimal alignment of the
distances, and one concealed column.  The Common name column
is the third in the \latex\ deluxetable but does not appear when the article
is compiled. This hidden column can be shown simply by changing the ``h'' in
the column identifier preamble to another valid value.  This table also
uses {\tt\string\tablenum} to renumber the table because a \latex\ tabular
table was inserted before it.

\subsubsection{Splitting a table into multiple horizontal components}

Since the AAS Journals are now all electronic with no print version there is
no reason why tables can not be as wide as authors need them to be.
However, there are some artificial limitations based on the width of a
print page.  The old way around this limitation was to rotate into 
landscape mode and use the smallest available table font
sizes, e.g. {\tt\string\tablewidth}, to get the table to fit.
Unfortunately, this was not always enough but now along with the hide column
option outlined in Section \ref{subsubsec:hide} there is a new way to break
a table into two or three components so that it flows down a page by
invoking a new table type, splittabular or splitdeluxetable. Within these
tables a new ``B'' column separator is introduced.  Much like the vertical
bar option, ``$\vert$'', that produces a vertical table lines 
the new ``B'' separator indicates where to \underline{B}reak
a table.  Up to two ``B''s may be included.

Table 2 % \ref{tab:deluxesplit} this freaks it out when it is used!
shows how to split a wide deluxetable into three parts with
the {\tt\string\splitdeluxetable} command.  The {\tt\string\colnumbers}
option is on to show how the automatic column numbering carries through the
second table component, see Section \ref{subsubsec:autonumber}.

\subsection{Figures\label{subsec:figures}}

%% The "ht!" tells LaTeX to put the figure "here" first, at the "top" next

from page charges to digital quanta in April 2011.  \label{fig:general}}
\end{figure}

Authors can include a wide number of different graphics with their articles
but encapsulated postscript (EPS) or portable document format (PDF) are
encouraged. These range from general figures all authors are familiar with
to new enhanced graphics that can only be fully experienced in HTML.  The
later include figure sets, animations and interactive figures.  All
enhanced graphics require a static two dimensional representation in the
manuscript to serve as the example for the reader. All figures should
include detailed and descriptive captions.  These captions are absolutely
critical for readers for whom the enhanced figure is inaccessible either
due to a disability or offline access.  This portion of the article
provides examples for setting up all these types in with the latest version
of \aastex.

\subsection{General figures\label{subsec:general}}

\aastex\ has a {\tt\string\plotone} command to display a figure consisting
of one EPS/PDF file.  Figure \ref{fig:general} is an example which shows
the approximate changes in the subscription costs and author publication
charges from 1991 to 2013 in the AAS Journals.  For a general figure
consisting of two EPS/PDF files the {\tt\string\plottwo} command can be
used to position the two image files side by side.

Both {\tt\string\plotone} and {\tt\string\plottwo} take a
{\tt\string\caption} and an optional {\tt\string\figurenum} command to
specify the figure number\footnote{It is better to not use
{\tt\string\figurenum} and let \latex\ auto-increment all the figures. If you
do use this command you need to mark all of them accordingly.}.  Each is
based on the {\tt\string graphicx} package command,
{\tt\string\includegraphics}.  Authors are welcome to use
{\tt\string\includegraphics} along with its optional arguments that control
the height, width, scale, and position angle of a file within the figure.
More information on the full usage of {\tt\string\includegraphics} can be
found at \break
\url{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing\_Graphics\#Including\_graphics}.

\subsection{Grid figures}

Including more than two EPS/PDF files in a single figure call can be tricky to
easily format.  To make the process easier for authors \aastex\ v6 offers
{\tt\string\gridline} which allows any number of individual EPS/PDF file
calls within a single figure.  Each file cited in a {\tt\string\gridline}
will be displayed in a row.  By adding more {\tt\string\gridline} calls an
author can easily construct a matrix X by Y individual files as a
single general figure.

For each {\tt\string\gridline} command a EPS/PDF file is called by one of
four different commands.  These are {\tt\string\fig},
{\tt\string\rightfig}, {\tt\string\leftfig}, and {\tt\string\boxedfig}.
The first file call specifies no image position justification while the
next two will right and left justify the image, respectively.  The
{\tt\string\boxedfig} is similar to {\tt\string\fig} except that a box is
drawn around the figure file when displayed. Each of these commands takes
three arguments.  The first is the file name.  The second is the width that
file should be displayed at.  While any natural \latex\ unit is allowed, it
is recommended that author use fractional units with the
{\tt\string\textwidth}.  The last argument is text for a subcaption.

Figure \ref{fig:pyramid} shows an inverted pyramid of individual
figure constructed with six individual EPS files using the
{\tt\string\gridline} option.

\begin{figure*}
\gridline{\fig{V2491_Cyg.pdf}{0.3\textwidth}{(a)}
          \fig{HV_Cet.pdf}{0.3\textwidth}{(b)}

\label{fig:pyramid}}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Enhanced graphics}

Enhanced graphics have an example figure to serve as an example for the
reader and the full graphical item available in the published HTML article.
This includes Figure sets, animations, and interactive figures. The 
Astronomy Image Explorer (\url{http://www.astroexplorer.org/}) provides 
access to all the figures published in the AAS Journals since they offered
an electronic version which was in the mid 1990s. You can filter image
searches by specific terms, year, journal, or type. The type filter is 
particularly useful for finding all published enhanced graphics. As of
March 2021 there are over 4000 videos, 1300 figure sets, and 100 interactive
figures. The next sections describe how to include these types of graphics
in your own manuscripts.

\subsubsection{Figure sets}

The grid commands given above works great for a limited set of individual
figure files but what do you do if you have many 10s or 100s or even 1000s of
individual figure files? Figure sets represents a virtual flip book of a
large group of similar style figures.  The derived PDF article will only
shows an example figure while the enhanced content is available in the
figure set in the HTML edition.  The advantage of a figure set gives the
reader the ability to easily sort through a large collection to find
individual component figures.  The advantage to the author is that grouping
similar figures into a figure set can result in significant cost savings in
terms of reduced publication charges, see Appendix B. All of the figure set
components, along with their html framework, are also available to the reader
for download in a single .tar.gz package.

Special \latex\ mark up is required to create a figure set.  Prior to
\aastex\ v6 the underlying mark up commands had to be inserted by hand
but is now included.  Note that when an article with figure set is compiled
in \latex\ none of the component figures are shown and a floating Figure
Set caption will appear in the resulting PDF.

\url{http://authortools.aas.org/FIGSETS/make-figset.html} to generate their
own specific figure set mark up to incorporate into their \latex\ articles.

\subsubsection{Animations \label{animation}}

Authors may, and are in fact encouraged, to include animations in their
manuscripts. The video will stream inline with the published article and
also be available for download.  When writing the manuscript, a stand alone
figure is necessary to serve as an example for the reader.  Ideally, this
is a single still frame from the animation but in some case the animation
may only represent a small portion of the example figure, say one many
panels as shown in Figure \ref{fig:video}. Regardless, it is very
important that the author provide descriptive text in the figure caption
including start and stop times and the video duration. Authors should
review the AAS animation guidelines in the graphics guide at
\url{https://journals.aas.org/graphics-guide/#animations}.

\begin{figure}

\end{interactive}
\caption{Figure 1 from \citet{2018ApJ...868L..33L}. AIA 171\AA (a,b), 
AIA 131\AA (c), and AIA 304\AA images are shown. The red rectangle 
in (a) shows the field of view of the other panels. An animation of 
panels (b-d) is available. It covers 8 hours of observing beginning 
at 01:00 UT on 2012 January 19. The video duration is 20 seconds. 
\label{fig:video}}
\end{figure}

Animations and interactive figures (Section \ref{sec:interactive}) should 
use the {\tt\string\begin{interactive}} environment in the figure call. This 
environment
places a blue border around the figure to indicate that the figure is 
enhanced in the published HTML article. The
command also serves to alert the publisher what files are used to generate
the dynamic HTML content. {\tt\string\interactive} takes two arguments. The
first details the type and currently only three are allowed. The types are
{\tt\string js} for generic javascript interactive figures, 
{\tt\string animation} for inline videos, and 
{\tt\string timeseries} for interactive light curves produced
by astropy \citet{2013A&A...558A..33A}\footnote{To be release in the 
summer of 2019}. If these types are not provide the compiler will issue an
error and quit. The second argument is the file that produces the enhanced
feature in the HTML article.

\subsubsection{Interactive figures \label{sec:interactive}}

Interactive figures give the reader the ability to manipulate the
information contained in an image which can add clarity or help further the
author's narrative.  These figures consist of two parts, a static 
representative figure for the manuscript and the dynamic javascript plus
HTML framework that allows for interactive control.

An example of an interactive figure is a 3D model.
The underlying figure is a X3D file while x3dom.js is the javascript driver
that displays it. An author created interface is added via a html wrapper.
The first 3D model published by the AAS Journals using this technique was
\citet{2014ApJ...793..127V}.  

Figure \ref{fig:interactive} provides an interactive example which can be
run locally to demonstrate how a simple javascript plus html interface
allows a reader to switch between figures. The necessary files for this
particular interactive figure are in the {\tt\string interactive.tar.gz}
file included with this package. Unpack the file and point the browser to
the local html file. In this case, the javascript that runs the interactive
buttons is embedded in the html file but it could just as easily be calls
to external javascript libraries. Ideally, the javascript should be
included with the submitted package of interactive files to minimize
external dependencies within the published article.

\begin{figure}

the upper panels do not share a common ordinate due to the differing number
of planet detections around stars in each spectral type bin. The
interactive version has two buttons that allows one to turn the optical and
NIR layers. \label{fig:interactive}}

tutorials and examples.

\section{Displaying mathematics} \label{sec:displaymath}

The most common mathematical symbols and formulas are in the amsmath
package. \aastex\ requires this package so there is no need to
specifically call for it in the document preamble.  Most modern \latex\
distributions already contain this package.  If you do not have this
package or the other required packages, revtex4-1, latexsym, graphicx,
amssymb, longtable, and epsf, they can be obtained from 
\url{http://www.ctan.org}

Mathematics can be displayed either within the text, e.g. $E = mc^2$, or
separate from in an equation.  In order to be properly rendered, all inline
math text has to be declared by surrounding the math by dollar signs (\$).

A complex equation example with inline math as part of the explanation
follows.

\begin{equation}
\bar v(p_2,\sigma_2)P_{-\tau}\hat a_1\hat a_2\cdots
\hat a_nu(p_1,\sigma_1) ,
\end{equation}
where $p$ and $\sigma$ label the initial $e^{\pm}$ four-momenta
and helicities $(\sigma = \pm 1)$, $\hat a_i=a^\mu_i\gamma_\nu$
and $P_\tau=\frac{1}{2}(1+\tau\gamma_5)$ is a chirality projection
operator $(\tau = \pm1)$.  This produces a single line formula.  \latex\ will
auto-number this and any subsequent equations.  If no number is desired then
the {\tt\string equation} call should be replaced with {\tt\string displaymath}.

\latex\ can also handle a a multi-line equation.  Use {\tt\string eqnarray}
for more than one line and end each line with a
\textbackslash\textbackslash.  Each line will be numbered unless the
\textbackslash\textbackslash\ is preceded by a {\tt\string\nonumber}
command.  Alignment points can be added with ampersands (\&).  There should be
two ampersands per line. In the examples they are centered on the equal
symbol.
\begin{eqnarray}
\gamma^\mu  & = &
 \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & \sigma^\mu_+ \\
\sigma^\mu_- & 0
\end{array}     \right) ,
 \gamma^5= \left(

\section{Revision tracking and color highlighting} \label{sec:highlight}

Authors sometimes use color to highlight changes to their manuscript in
response to editor and referee comments.  In \aastex\ new commands
have been introduced to make this easier and formalize the process. 

The first method is through a new set of editing mark up commands that
specifically identify what has been changed.  These commands are
{\tt\string\added\{<text>\}}, {\tt\string\deleted\{<text>\}}, and
{\tt\string\replaced\{<old text>\}\{<replaced text>\}}. To activate these
commands the {\tt\string trackchanges} option must be used in the
{\tt\string\documentclass} call.  When compiled this will produce the
marked text in red.  The {\tt\string\explain\{<text>\}} can be used to add
text to provide information to the reader describing the change.  Its
output is purple italic font. To see how {\tt\string\added\{<important
added info>\}}, {\tt\string\deleted\{<this can be deleted text>\}},
{\tt\string\replaced\{<old data>\}\{<replaced data>\}}, and \break
{\tt\string\explain\{<text explaining the change>\}} commands will produce
\added{important added information}\deleted{, deleted text, and }
\replaced{old data}{and replaced data,} toggle between versions compiled with
and without the {\tt\string trackchanges} option.\explain{text explaining
the change}

A summary list of all these tracking commands can be produced at the end of
the article by adding the {\tt\string\listofchanges} just before the
{\tt\string\end\{document\}} call.  The page number for each change will be
provided. If the {\tt\string linenumbers} option is also included in the
documentclass call then not only will all the lines in the article be
numbered for handy reference but the summary list will also include the
line number for each change.

The second method does not have the ability to highlight the specific
nature of the changes but does allow the author to document changes over
multiple revisions.  The commands are {\tt\string\edit1\{<text>\}},
{\tt\string\edit2\{<text>\}} and {\tt\string\edit3\{<text>\}} and they
produce {\tt\string<text>} that is highlighted in bold, bold+italic and
bold+underline, respectively.  Authors should use the first command to
\edit1{indicated which text has been changed from the first revision.}  The
second command is to highlight \edit2{new or modified text from a second
revision}.  If a third revision is needed then the last command should be used 
\edit3{to show this changed text}.  Since over 90\% of all manuscripts are
accepted after the 3rd revision these commands make it easy to identify
what text has been added and when.  Once the article is accepted all the
highlight color can be turned off simply by adding the
{\tt\string\turnoffediting} command in the preamble. Likewise, the new commands
{\tt\string\turnoffeditone}, {\tt\string\turnoffedittwo}, and
{\tt\string\turnoffeditthree} can be used to only turn off the 
{\tt\string\edit1\{<text>\}}, {\tt\string\edit2\{<text>\}} and 
{\tt\string\edit3\{<text>\}}, respectively.

Similar to marking editing changes with the {\tt\string\edit} options there
are also the {\tt\string\authorcomments1\{<text>\}}, 
{\tt\string\authorcomments2\{<text>\}} and
{\tt\string\authorcomments3\{<text>\}} commands.  These produce the same
bold red, italic blue and underlined purple text but when the
{\tt\string\turnoffediting} command is present the {\tt\string<text>}
material does not appear in the manuscript.  Authors can use these commands
to mark up text that they are not sure should appear in the final
manuscript or as a way to communicate comments between co-authors when
writing the article.

\section{Software and third party data repository citations} \label{sec:cite}

The AAS Journals would like to encourage authors to change software and
third party data repository references from the current standard of a
footnote to a first class citation in the bibliography.  As a bibliographic
citation these important references will be more easily captured and credit
will be given to the appropriate people.

The first step to making this happen is to have the data or software in
a long term repository that has made these items available via a persistent
identifier like a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).  A list of repositories
that satisfy this criteria plus each one's pros and cons are given at \break
\url{https://github.com/AASJournals/Tutorials/tree/master/Repositories}.

In the bibliography the format for data or code follows this format: \\

\noindent author year, title, version, publisher, prefix:identifier\\

\citet{2015ApJ...805...23C} provides a example of how the citation in the
article references the external code at
\doi{10.5281/zenodo.15991}.  Unfortunately, bibtex does
not have specific bibtex entries for these types of references so the
``@misc'' type should be used.  The Repository tutorial explains how to
code the ``@misc'' type correctly.  The most recent aasjournal.bst file,
available with \aastex\ v6, will output bibtex ``@misc'' type properly.

%% IMPORTANT! The old "\acknowledgment" command has be depreciated. It was
%% not robust enough to handle our new dual anonymous review requirements and
%% thus been replaced with the acknowledgment environment. If you try to 
%% compile with \acknowledgment you will get an error print to the screen
%% and in the compiled pdf.

%% Appendix material should be preceded with a single \appendix command.
%% There should be a \section command for each appendix. Mark appendix
%% subsections with the same markup you use in the main body of the paper.

%% Each Appendix (indicated with \section) will be lettered A, B, C, etc.
%% The equation counter will reset when it encounters the \appendix
%% command and will number appendix equations (A1), (A2), etc. The
%% Figure and Table counter will not reset.

\appendix

\section{Appendix information}

Appendices can be broken into separate sections just like in the main text.
The only difference is that each appendix section is indexed by a letter
(A, B, C, etc.) instead of a number.  Likewise numbered equations have
the section letter appended.  Here is an equation as an example.
\begin{equation}
I = \frac{1}{1 + d_{1}^{P (1 + d_{2} )}}
\end{equation}
Appendix tables and figures should not be numbered like equations. Instead
they should continue the sequence from the main article body.

\section{Author publication charges} \label{sec:pubcharge}

Finally some information about the AAS Journal's publication charges.
In April 2011 the traditional way of calculating author charges based on 
the number of printed pages was changed.  The reason for the change
was due to a recognition of the growing number of article items that could not 
be represented in print. Now author charges are determined by a number of
digital ``quanta''.  A single quantum is 350 words, one figure, one table,
and one enhanced digital item.  For the latter this includes machine readable
tables, figure sets, animations, and interactive figures.  The current cost
for the different quanta types is available at 
\url{https://journals.aas.org/article-charges-and-copyright/#author_publication_charges}. 
Authors may use the ApJL length calculator to get a {\tt rough} estimate of 
the number of word and float quanta in their manuscript. The calculator 
is located at \url{https://authortools.aas.org/ApJL/betacountwords.html}.

\section{Rotating tables} \label{sec:rotate}

The process of rotating tables into landscape mode is slightly different in
\aastex v6.31. Instead of the {\tt\string\rotate} command, a new environment
has been created to handle this task. To place a single page table in a
landscape mode start the table portion with
{\tt\string\begin\{rotatetable\}} and end with
{\tt\string\end\{rotatetable\}}.

Tables that exceed a print page take a slightly different environment since
both rotation and long table printing are required. In these cases start
with {\tt\string\begin\{longrotatetable\}} and end with
{\tt\string\end\{longrotatetable\}}. Table \ref{chartable} is an
example of a multi-page, rotated table. The {\tt\string\movetabledown}
command can be used to help center extremely wide, landscape tables. The
command {\tt\string\movetabledown=1in} will move any rotated table down 1
inch.

A handy "cheat sheet" that provides the necessary \latex\ to produce 17 
different types of tables is available at \url{http://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex/aasguide.html#table_cheat_sheet}.

\section{IAU recommendations for nominal units \label{nominal}}

The IAU 2015 resolution B3 defines nominal solar and planetary values by
establishing conversions between solar and planetary values and SI units.
The rational and specifications are given in \citet{2016AJ....152...41P}.
The recommended nominal conversion constants for \latex\ have been
incorporate into v6.31 to help authors follow the IAU resolution.

The general commands take this form:

\vskip12pt
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{\vrule height 14pt depth 6pt width0pt}lll}
Command&Example&Results\\
\verb+\nom{}+&\verb+\nom{Q}+&\nom{Q}\\
\verb+\Eenom{}+&\verb+\Eenom{Q}+&\Eenom{Q}\\
\verb+\Epnom{}+&\verb+\Epnom{Q}+&\Epnom{Q}\\
\verb+\Jenom{}+&\verb+\Jenom{Q}+&\Jenom{Q}\\
\verb+\Jpnom{}+&\verb+\Jpnom{Q}+&\Jpnom{Q}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vskip12pt

which can be used for any units the author requires. Examples of 
the most common uses would be:

\vskip12pt
\begin{tabular}{@{\vrule height 14pt depth 6pt width 0pt}llllp{3in}}
1.&\verb+\nom{(GM)}+& \nom{(GM)} &=& nominal solar mass parameter\\
2.&\verb+\nom{R}+&\nom{R} &=& nominal solar radius\\
3.&\verb+\nom{S}+& \nom{S}&=&  nominal total solar irradiance\\
4.&\verb+\nom{L}+& \nom{L}  &=&nominal solar luminosity\\
\end{tabular}
\vskip12pt

AASTeX v6.31 also contains specific commands for other commonly used 
units. These are:

\vskip24pt
\begin{tabular}{@{\vrule height 14pt depth 6pt width 0pt}llllp{3in}}
1.&\verb+\nomSolarEffTemp+& \nomSolarEffTemp&=& nominal solar effective temperature\\
2.&\verb+\nomTerrEqRadius+&\nomTerrEqRadius  &=& nominal terrestrial
equatorial radius\\
&\verb+\nomTerrPolarRadius+ &\nomTerrPolarRadius &=& nominal
terrestrial polar radius\\
&\verb+\nomTerrEqRadius+&\nomTerrEqRadius&& should be used if equatorial
vs.~polar radius is not explicitly specified.\\
3.&\verb+\nomJovianEqRadius+&\nomJovianEqRadius&=& nominal one-bar equatorial radii of
Jupiter\\
&\verb+\nomJovianPolarRadius+&\nomJovianPolarRadius &=& nominal polar radii of Jupiter\\
&\verb+\nomJovianEqRadius+&\nomJovianEqRadius&& should be used if Jovian equatorial
vs.~polar radius is not explicitly specified.\\
4.&\verb+\nomTerrMass+ &\nomTerrMass &=& nominal terrestrial mass
parameter\\
&\verb+\nomJovianMass+ &\nomJovianMass &=& nominal Jovian mass parameter\\
\end{tabular}
\vskip12pt

All of these commands work equally well in text and math mode.

\section{Using Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters}

Authors have the option to include names in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (CJK) 
characters in addition to the English name. The names will be displayed 
in parentheses after the English name. The way to do this in AASTeX is to 
use the CJK package available at \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/cjk?lang=en}.
Further details on how to implement this and solutions for common problems,
please go to \url{https://journals.aas.org/nonroman/}.

%% For this sample we use BibTeX plus aasjournals.bst to generate the
